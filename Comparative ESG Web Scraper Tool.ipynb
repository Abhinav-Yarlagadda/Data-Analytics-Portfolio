    "Once a niche field, ESG has grown in prominence as a vital indicator for investors to assess the various industries and market sectors. Representing three primary standards for company valuation, ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance criteria. The environmental metric focuses on the sustainable use of the Earth's resources, encompassing the impact on biodiversity to pollution and deforestation from business operations. On the other hand, the social metric concentrates on labor practices along with diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workforce among other social policies. Lastly, goverance is measured through how well a company abides by ethical and govermental policies, promoting transparent managerial practices. These three pillars of the ESG framework are collectively applied to capture the non-financial risks aspects of a company's operational scope. "

    "In order to assess the ESG performance of a company, ESG scores from independent third-party rating agencies are often factored in for socially motivated shareholders. However, as ESG investing gains more and more traction for screening investments, a major flaw in the ESG rating system must be addressed. Since there are no standardized regulations on how ESG indicators are to be evaluated by rating agencies, the scores are usually subjective to the weighting methodology employed by the specific agency. Therefore, ESG ratings tend to conflict with each other as a certain agency may weigh more heavily on sustainability for their assessment, while another may focus on goverance, which can lead to inconsistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, comparing ESG metrics and rating standards of different agenices paints a more clear picture that investors can use to screen prospective investments. With that goal in mind, I have created two web scraper tools below that will allow a user to exract a comapny's ESG metrics from both the Sustainalytics and S&P Global rating agencies. By analyzing ESG scoring features of the two rating standards, investors will be able to simultaneously access a comprehensive outlook of a company's ESG framework, empowering them to make conscientious investment decisions."
