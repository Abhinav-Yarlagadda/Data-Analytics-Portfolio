# Environmental Policy Expenditures Visualization

Based on 4 datasets of environmental policy metrics, the purpose of this project 
is to visualize the related data to provide meaningful insights about the state 
of environmental policy expenditures across the world. The data was first cleaned
and then explored using PostgreSQL. After properly formatted, the data was then
visualized in a Tableau dashboard to best illustrate any relationships or patterns
between the environmental policy metrics.
