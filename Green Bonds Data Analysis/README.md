# Green Bonds Data Analysis
The primary goal of this data analysis project on green bonds is to gain insights into green bond policies, the market for green bonds, and their impact on sustainable development. Green bonds are financial instruments designed to fund projects with positive environmental benefits. By analyzing green bond datasets, we seek to visualize data regarding green bonds in a meaningful way to raise awareness on the use of green bonds as a means of advancing environmental sustainability.
